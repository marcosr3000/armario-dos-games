This is my first project in a solo flight. It's a [webpage](https://marcosr3000.github.io/armario-dos-games/) where I catalog my game collection in a colorful and audible way. You'll see, for every game title, the cover, basic information such as developer company and release date and listen the theme song. The games are organized by compatible console.

Some of the tools that I applied: <br>

<ul>
  <li>📲 responsive design;<br>
  <li>🖼️ media queries;<br>
  <li>📖 semanthic HTML;<br>
  <li>🗳️ box model;<br>
  <li>🔡 external fonts;<br>
  <li>👨‍💻 CSS variables.
</ul>

After I uploaded the project to a webpage, I made a short video explaining the process to create the page, such as the concept, the tools I used, what I have learned and faced challenges.
